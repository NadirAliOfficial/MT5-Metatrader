# MT5-Metatrader
This Python project integrates with MetaTrader 5 (MT5) to retrieve historical market data (OHLC and volume) for various timeframes (M5, M15, H1, H4, Daily). The data is then stored in Pandas DataFrames for further processing and analysis. This project serves as the foundation for developing trading strategies and performing technical analysis.
